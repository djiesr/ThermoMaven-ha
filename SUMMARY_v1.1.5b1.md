# ThermoMaven Integration - Version 1.1.5b1 Summary

## 🎯 Release Overview
**Version**: 1.1.5b1 (Beta)  
**Release Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Type**: Bug Fix Release (Beta)

## 🐛 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Sensor Duplication Problem
**Issue**: Multiple sensors were being created for the same device during MQTT updates
**Root Cause**: Device tracking was not persistent across coordinator updates
**Solution**: Implemented persistent device tracking using `coordinator._added_devices`
**Impact**: Users will no longer see duplicate sensors in their entity list

### 2. MQTT Data "Unavailable" Issue
**Issue**: Temperature updates via MQTT were showing as "unavailable" instead of actual values
**Root Cause**: MQTT status reports were not properly processed and stored
**Solution**: Enhanced MQTT message processing and data persistence
**Impact**: Real-time temperature updates now work correctly via MQTT

### 3. Device Data Persistence
**Issue**: Device data was lost when API calls failed but MQTT was still sending updates
**Root Cause**: No fallback mechanism for preserving device data
**Solution**: Added logic to preserve previous device data during API failures
**Impact**: More reliable operation during network issues

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Code Modifications
- **sensor.py**: Fixed sensor duplication with persistent device tracking
- **__init__.py**: Improved MQTT data processing and device persistence
- **thermomaven_api.py**: Enhanced MQTT message handling

### Architecture Improvements
- Better separation between API and MQTT data handling
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced data persistence mechanisms

## 📊 Expected User Experience

### Before (v1.1.4)
- ❌ Duplicate sensors appearing in entity list
- ❌ MQTT temperature updates showing as "unavailable"
- ❌ Inconsistent device data during network issues

### After (v1.1.5b1)
- ✅ Single set of sensors per device
- ✅ Real-time temperature updates via MQTT
- ✅ Reliable device data persistence
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Primary Testing
1. **Sensor Duplication Test**
   - Add integration
   - Verify only one set of sensors per device
   - Check that MQTT updates don't create duplicates

2. **MQTT Temperature Updates**
   - Monitor temperature sensor values
   - Verify real-time updates via MQTT
   - Confirm values are not "unavailable"

3. **Device Persistence**
   - Test with intermittent network issues
   - Verify device data is preserved
   - Check sensor availability during API failures

### Secondary Testing
- Integration reload/restart behavior
- Service call functionality (`thermomaven.sync_devices`)
- Log message clarity and debugging

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Installation
- Compatible with existing configurations
- No breaking changes
- Automatic cleanup of duplicate entities

### Monitoring
- Watch for sensor duplication in logs
- Monitor MQTT connection stability
- Verify temperature update frequency

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Zero duplicate sensors** after installation
- **MQTT temperature updates** working in real-time
- **Device persistence** during network interruptions
- **Improved user satisfaction** with sensor reliability

### Monitoring Points
- Entity registry cleanliness
- MQTT message processing success rate
- API fallback effectiveness
- User-reported issues reduction

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Beta Phase)
- Deploy to beta testers
- Monitor logs and user feedback
- Address any remaining issues

### Short-term (Stable Release)
- Release stable v1.1.5 based on beta feedback
- Update documentation if needed
- Plan next feature release

### Long-term
- Continue MQTT reliability improvements
- Consider additional sensor types
- Explore advanced device features
