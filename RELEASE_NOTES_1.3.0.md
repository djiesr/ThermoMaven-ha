## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Optimized Startup Sequence
```
1. Login to API
2. Create Coordinator
3. Setup MQTT (BEFORE first refresh) ← NEW!
4. Wait for MQTT device list (max 10s) ← NEW!
5. First data refresh with complete data
6. Create sensors with correct deviceId
7. ✅ Integration ready!
```

### MQTT Synchronization
- **Active waiting** for device list
- **Flag system** to track readiness
- **Timeout protection** (10 seconds)
- **Prevents incomplete sensor creation**

### Coordinator Refresh Timing
